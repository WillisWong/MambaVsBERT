# Project Overview

This project involves performing sentiment analysis using multiple datasets and models. The primary focus is on exploring the IMDb and SST-2 datasets, utilizing different models and techniques for natural language processing (NLP). The results of the experiments are saved and stored in separate folders for each dataset.
